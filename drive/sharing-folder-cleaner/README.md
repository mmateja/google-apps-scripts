# Sharing folder cleaner

A script removing files older than 14 days from a specific Google Drive folder.

I use it to automatically remove files from my sharing folder. My usage pattern is similar to file sharing services.
When I want to share a file with a friend, I upload it to the sharing folder and send them the link.
They have 14 days to download it before the file will get removed automatically.
